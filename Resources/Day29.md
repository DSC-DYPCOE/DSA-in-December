✨ Dynamic Programming Level-2 ✨

📌 Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.
If any problem can be divided into subproblems, which in turn are divided into smaller subproblems, and if there are overlapping among these subproblems, then the solutions to these subproblems can be saved for future reference. In this way, the efficiency of the CPU can be enhanced. This method of solving a solution is referred to as dynamic programming.
Such problems involve repeatedly calculating the value of the same subproblems to find the optimum solution.
