✨ 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭: 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘁𝘆 ✨

// Good Morning everyone 🌞, we are starting this activity with the vision of improvement and building consistency in students, today is the first day of DSA in December, I hope you are excited to get started with it! 🚀

📌 An important question while programming is: How efficient is an algorithm or piece of code?
Efficiency covers lots of resources, including:
• CPU (time) usage
• memory usage
• disk usage
• network usage
All are important but we are mostly concerned about CPU time.
Be careful to differentiate between:

1. Performance: how much time/memory/disk/etc. is actually used when a program is run. This depends on the machine, compiler, etc. as well as the code we write.
2. Complexity: how do the resource requirements of a program or algorithm scale, i.e. what happens as the size of the problem being solved by the code gets larger. Complexity affects performance but not vice-versa.
   The time required by a function/method is proportional to the number of "basic operations" that it performs.
   Here are some examples of basic operations:
   • one arithmetic operation (e.g. a+b / a\*b)
   • one assignment (e.g. int x = 5)
   • one condition/test (e.g. x == 0)
   • one input read (e.g. reading a variable from console)
   • one output write (e.g. writing a variable on console)
