✨ DAY 26: Graph (Prims, Kruskal, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, Union Find Algorithm ✨

📌 Graphs are mathematical structures that reflect the pairwise relationship between things. A graph is a type of flow structure that displays the interactions of several objects. It may be represented by utilizing the two fundamental components, nodes and edges.
