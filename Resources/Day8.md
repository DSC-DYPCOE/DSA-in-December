📌 When we declare a variable or an array of any data type the space occupied by them in the system's memory remains constant throughout the execution of the program. Sometimes the constant space allocated at the compile-time may fall short, and to increase the space during run-time we came through the concept of Dynamic Memory Allocation. Allocation and Deallocation of memory at run-time in C are done using the concept of Dynamic Memory Allocation. It is a method in which we use different library functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() to allocate and deallocate a memory block during run-time.
It is considered as a very important topic because almost every Data Structure (such as Linked Lists, Stack, Queue, Trees, etc.) is associated with the concept of Dynamic Memory Allocation.
