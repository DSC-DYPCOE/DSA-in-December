📌 C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.

📌 A linked list is a linear dynamic data structure to store data items. We have already seen arrays in our previous topics on basic C++. We also know that arrays are linear data structure that stores data items in contiguous locations.
Unlike arrays, the linked list does not store data items in contiguous memory locations.
