✨ Day 30: Backtracking ✨

📌 Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till reaching any level of the search tree). Backtracking can also be said as an improvement to the brute force approach. So basically, the idea behind the backtracking technique is that it searches for a solution to a problem among all the available options.
