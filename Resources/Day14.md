✨ 𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭4: Sorting ( Quick Sort + Merge Sort)✨

🙋🏻‍♀️ We have Studied basics of Sorting on Day 4 (Refer day 4 - 4th dec )

📌 What is Quick Sort ?

Quicksort is an algorithm used to quickly sort items within an array no matter how big the array is. It does this through a divide-and-conquer method that divides a single large array into two smaller ones and then repeats this process for all created arrays until the sort is complete.

📌 What is Merge Sort ?

Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer based on the idea of breaking down a list into several sub-lists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sub lists in a manner that results into a sorted list.
