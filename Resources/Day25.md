✨ Day 25: Trie & Huffman Coding ✨

📌 Trie data structure is defined as a Tree based data structure that is used for storing some collection of strings and performing efficient search operations on them. The word Trie is derived from reTRIEval, which means finding something or obtaining it.

📌 Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.
